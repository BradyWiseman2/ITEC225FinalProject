2025 Update: My final project for Intermediate Programming. At this point I became interested in developing a 2D platformer, and decided to experiment with that for my final project.
It was here that I felt the limitations of Winforms as a game engine the most, and is a prime example of me trying my best to involve as little winforms in my winform as possible.
At this point, it became clear that I should move on to a proper game engine, and I proceeded to do that for my advanced programming final. Some key learning points here involved events, interfaces, and polymorphism.
